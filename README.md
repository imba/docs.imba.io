# Welcome to the Imba Documentation 👋🏾

Imba is a programming language for building amazing web applications.  It's
heavily optimized for modern browsers.

## Benefits

Below are just a few of the benefits of using Imba

- A friendly full stack language, You can use it on the server and the client. 
- Seamless integration with JavaScript. You can easily reuse existing JavaScript
code (imported / require) into Imba code. 
- Performance builtin with the Memoized DOM.  This frees you up to focus on
their application and business logic.

Imba is 100% open source and you can find the source on the
[imba/imba](https://github.com/imba/imba) repository.

## Origin

Imba was created around 2010 by Sindre Aarsaether (@somebee) as a private
project to port Ruby to browsers. As time progressed, the project morphed into
an effort to create an optimal platform for end-to-end end web development.

Even though the speed was not one of the original goals, the implementation of
the Imba's DOM reconciler, also known as 'Memoized DOM', has stood the test of
time, and is, to date, one of the fastest DOM reconciler designs on the market.
Many of today's high-performance designs use the same or similar techniques.

The language is heavily inspired by Ruby, Python, CoffeeScript and JavaScript.

### The Name

The name Imba comes from the term 'imbalance' used in the gaming world to point
to a character or an item that is overpowered / unjustly good and therefore
causes the gameplay to become imbalanced.
