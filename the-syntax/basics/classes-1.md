# Classes

## Why use Classes?

{% hint style="info" %}
What in JavaScript is referred to as a _Constructor_ or _Prototype_, Imba calls a _**Class**_, as it is commonly known in other programming languages.
{% endhint %}

To understand the use of classes, let's look back at objects really quick.  
This is an object that contains properties for John.

```ruby
var john =
    age: 20
    birthYear: 1999
    isMarried: false
```

If we want to create a new object we could duplicate the code and change the values.

```ruby
var peter =
    age: 30
    birthYear: 1989
    isMarried: false
```

We could keep doing this over and over, but there is a better way... _Classes!_  
You can think of classes as some sort of blueprint for creating objects that will help you keep your code DRY and easier to maintain as you only need make changes to the Class to affect all its instances.

## Declare a Class

A Class is simply declared with the keyword of `class` followed by the desired name for that class. Though it is not enforced, we recommend the common naming convention for classes, which is `UpperCase`. 

> `camelCase` is conventionally reserved for functions and methods.

Now, let's make a Class to serve as a blueprint from which we will instantiate a new John Object in a more efficient way.

```ruby
class Person
```

## Create Instance Class

{% hint style="danger" %}
V2 possible change:   
let Eric = Person.new  
let Eric = new Person
{% endhint %}

To create instances of classes in Imba you use the `new` method like `Array.new`, as opposed to the special `new Array()` syntax in JavaScript.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This syntax is not solely for classes created in Imba, but is used for creating any object, be it built in constructors in JavaScript like `Array`, `Object`, `RegEx` and any other class/constructor from other languages.
{% endhint %}

Let's create an instance of the Person Class in the Eric variable.

```ruby
class Person
let Eric = Person.new
```

We can see if the class has been applied by checking the constructor name of Eric.

```ruby
class Person
let Eric = Person.new

console.log Eric.constructor.name
>>> Person
```

## Instance Variable / Prop

Instance Variables in Imba are declared using the **prop** keyword. **Props** a variables that are scoped to the specific instance of a class or tag. They are not directly accessible from the global scope. Let's store our constructor name in a prop called type and print the result to the console.

```ruby
class Person
    prop type = this.constructor.name
let Eric = Person.new
```

By accessing the 'type' property on 'Eric', we should see "Person" in the console as we did before.

```ruby
class Person
    prop type = this.constructor.name
let Eric = Person.new

console.log Eric.type
>>> Person
```

## Instance Methods / Functions

Methods are simply functions that are scoped to the specific instance of a class. in the same way that props are simply variables that are scoped to the instance of class. Just as props, they cannot be accessed directly from the global scope. Only through the instances.

Let's create a method using the `def` keyword that will print our type to the console.

```ruby
class Person
    prop type = this.constructor.name
    def printType
        console.log type
```

Now we should be able to print the type to the console, by simply accessing the method.

```ruby
class Person
    prop type = this.constructor.name
    def printType
        console.log type

Eric.printType()
>>> Person
```

Methods, just like functions, are called using the `functionName()` syntax.   
If you don't have any parameters to call within the parenthesis, you can use a bang `!` instead of the parenthesis `()`. It makes more legible code.

```ruby
Eric.printType!
>>> Person
```

### Constructor, Initializer

{% hint style="danger" %}
Explain Initialize x,y,z vs prop.
{% endhint %}

## Instances

```ruby
class Person
    def constructor x, y, z
        name = x
        age = y
        job = z        
let john = Person.new 'John', 20, 'Teacher'
```

Imba's philosophy is that everything within objects is exposed through methods, so if we want to expose the John Instance of the Person Class, our Person class will need a method to expose that.

```ruby
class Person
    def constructor x, y, z
        @name = x
        @age = y
        @job = z
    def showName # method for exposing name.
        @name
```

Now if we would like to expose the name we would do so by accessing the `showName` method of the `john` object.

```ruby
console.log john.showName
```

Thought using methods is recommended, you could still access the instance variables directly.

```ruby
console.log john:_name
```

And don't forget that Methods, are functions of a class. So anything you can do in a function, you can do in a method.

```ruby
class Person
    def constructor x, y, z
        @name = x
        @age = y
        @job = z
    def showName
        console.log @name
    def birthYear
        let d = Date.new
        console.log d.getFullYear() - @age
    def showJob
        console.log @job.toUpperCase


let john = Person.new 'John', 20, 'Teacher'

john.showName
john.birthYear
john.showJob
```

{% code title="ConsoleLog" %}
```bash
# CONSOLE
> John
> 1999
> TEACHER
```
{% endcode %}

{% endhint %}

## Properties

> **ðŸ“ŒTODO** Explain advanced features of `prop` and `attr`. Also, there are changes in v2.

As mentioned earlier, Imba embraces the philosophy that classes should expose everything through methods. You can define properties on classes, which are automatically generated getters and setters.

If you want to get/set the title of a `Todo` in JavaScript, it's not uncommon to just get/set it as a property directly. In Imba, you would want to instead define _methods_ to set and get the title.

```ruby
class Todo
    prop title
```

The above is basically a quick way to define both a getter and a setter for the instance variable title.

```ruby
class Todo

    def title
        @title

    def title= value
        @title = value
```

## Prototypal Inheritance

![The Prototype Chain](../../.gitbook/assets/prototype-chain%20%281%29.png)

The _Eric_ object is an instance of the _Person_ Object, and the _Person_ object is an instance of the _Object_ of object. So the Eric object inherits the methods of the person Object, and from the person object's parent the _Object_ object.

As in JavaScript, so Imba will try to find a method in the exact object, if it cannot find it, it will look for method in parent object prototype, and so on, until there are no other object prototypes, in which case it will return null.

Null has no prototype, and it is the final link in the prototype chain, and undefined is returned.

### Summary

* Every JS & Imba Object has a **prototype property**, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript.
* The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want **other objects to inherit**.
* The Constructor's prototype property is **NOT** the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of **ALL** instances that re created through it.
* When a certain method \(or property\) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found, the search moves on to the object's prototype and continues up **prototype chain, until the method is found.**

## Inheritance

An important feature of Classes is its ability to inherit from other classes.

For example, an Athlete is also a person, so it makes sense to inherit the properties of a person so that if we ever update the person class, the Athlete's class will also be updated. It will also help us keep our code light.

```ruby
class Person 
    def constructor name, age
        @name = name
        @age = age

class Athlete
    def constructor name, age, trophies
        @name = name
        @age = age
        @trophies = trophies
```

We can use inheritance via the `<` symbol as you would with tags.

```ruby
class Person
    def constructor name, age
        @name = name
        @age = age
class King < Person
    def greet
        console.log "Your Royal Highness, King {@name}."
let john = King.new 'John', 20

john.greet

#console
> "Your Royal Highness, King John"
```

## Super

> ðŸ“Œ **TODO** Explain advanced use of super

Imba's inheritance relies on JavaScript prototypal inheritance, with some added conveniences.

```ruby
# Example borrowed from coffeescript.org
class Animal

    def consntructor name
        @name = name

    def move meters
        console.log "{@name} moved {meters}m."

class Snake < Animal
    def move
        console.log "Slithering..."
        super 5

class Horse < Animal
    def move
        console.log "Galloping..."
        super 45

var sam = Snake.new "Sammy the Python"
var tom = Horse.new "Tommy the Palomino"

sam.move
tom.move
```
