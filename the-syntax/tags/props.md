# Properties

Components are better when they can share data with other components, such as their parent components. Imba makes this easy via properties, or props for short, which are fundamentally ready-to-go variables of an object. Let‚Äôs go to the next page to see it in practice.

## tag props

```ruby
tag app-root
    prop page
```

### Dynamic prop data

```ruby
for item in names
    <h3 name=item>
```

### parent props

```ruby
tag name-counter
    def render
        <self>
```

## Declaring a Prop

To create a prop, we use the keyword `prop` followed by the `propName`: Makesure it‚Äôs indented inside your tag declaration, and you can then call the prop value anywhere in your component.

```ruby
export tag Likes
    prop likeCounter #new
    def render
        <self>
            <p> "Likes:"
                <b> likeCounter #new
```

Now let‚Äôs instantiate the component and pass a value to the prop.

```ruby
import Likes from './components/Likes.imba'

let counter = 0
tag App
    def increase
        counter++
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click.increase> "üëç"
            <Likes likeCounter=0> #new

Imba.mount <App>
```

## Dynamic Prop Values

We can also use dynamic data to pass a value down to our prop:

```ruby
let counter = 0
tag App
    def increase
        counter++
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click.increase> "üëç"
            <Likes likeCounter=counter> #modified

Imba.mount <App>
```

Go ahead and hit the like button, and watch the nested component receive likes.

## Default Prop Values

We can easily specify default values for props:

```ruby
export tag Likes
    prop likeCounter default: "üò™" #modified
    def render
        <self>
            <p> "Likes: "
                <b> likeCounter
```

Now when we instantiate the tag without the prop, it has a default value to fall back on:

```ruby
let counter = 0
tag App
    def increase
        counter++
    def render
        <self>
            <button :click.increase> "+1"
        <Likes likeCounter=1>
        <Likes>
```

## Getters & Setters

To create a prop, Imba creates a getter & setter methods, to get and set information in the instance variable.

But you don't have to specify the getter & setter if you don't want to:

```ruby
tag Home
    prop welcome
```

But in case you do, you can be specific by defining two functions instead:

```ruby
def property
    @property=value
def method
    @property
```

This means that you can get and set values to the prop by using the `@name` format. And to differentiate from other variables, it is good practice to do so.

So from now on, we will reference props with the @ symbol from within tags:

```ruby
tag Home
    prop loggedIn
    <p> "You are: " + @loggedIn
```

> NOTE: Props are only found in tags, not in classes. So the @ symbol has a different meaning within classes, but we'll explain more on that when we get there.

## V2

```ruby
tag app-root

    #name = 'there'
    get name
        #name

    set name value
        console.log('setting name to', value)
        #name = value

    def render
        <self>
            <p> "Hello {name ? name : 'there'}!"
            <input[name]>
```

## Questions

What are these called? Prop, Function, Objects?

```ruby
# Explain This
def setup
        @items = [
            {title: "Remember milk", done: false}
            {title: "Test custom events", done: false}
        ]
